I am currently a 2nd year PhD student working at [https://www.di.ens.fr DI ENS] and [https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-paris, INRIA]
(in the [https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/ SIERRA Team]), under the supervision of [https://www.di.ens.fr/~aspremon/ Alexandre d'Aspremont].
\n

I'm focusing on convex optimization problems and algorithms with a particular interest for adaptive methods and their complexity guarantees. I also have interest in compressed
sensing and optimal transport problem.\n

Here is a short [cvbarre.pdf resume] and my [research.html list of publications].
